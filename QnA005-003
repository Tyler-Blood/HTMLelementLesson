In webflow, how is does text styling affect the elements.

! - The child inherits the text style of the parent
  When an element has typography styles, these styles are passed down to its child and grandchild elements. For example, if you edit the font family on the Body element, all of its children elements will inherit the same font family.  Children can override styles inherited from parents and grandparents.

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics

  This will make the item look like a header but the browser will not recognize it as a header.
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics
<div></div>
  This will give the element an id but will not give it any semantic meaning.
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics

Question for the video "HTML5 Semantic Markup Tags & Layout - HTML Tutorial for Beginners | www.youtube.com"

What tag would you use for content that is not directly relevant but may be related to the content the user is currently looking at and displayed alongside the main content?

<p></p>
  The p tag denotes that the text is a paragraph.
! - <aside></aside>
  The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in. The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.
  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_aside.asp
<a href = “#”></a>
  The a tag would take the user to a different page and is, therefore, not what we’re looking for.
<ol></ol>
  The ol tag would start and close an ordered list and would not display the content alongside the main content in the DOM.
